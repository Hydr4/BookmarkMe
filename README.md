<b>BookmarkMe</b><br> <font color="red">version:</font> 1.0 <br><br>
BookmarkMe is an application which gives you the ability to bookmark and organize all your favorite links in separated folders according to your desires. In addition, it has a quick search feature, so you can search for a certain bookmarked link by its title or the url itself<br><br>
You can also export your bookmarks to a nice formatted html file, so you can share them with your friends.<br><br>
And you can import links from browser either, (Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox are the only supported for now)<br><br>
If you have any feedback you want to give us, or you want to contact, feel free to do so.<br><br>
